# Visual-Animation

|Visual Animations|

What you see in front of you is a basic rundown of a new project that I am currently working on; this will be a personal project of mine. Therefore, daily updates may not occur. 

This project will consist of various software engines. The primary one is Unity.

For the most part, this will be leaning more towards the visual interface side of things. With that said, that may vary depending on the direction I choose to go. Due to this project being experimental, it does not fall into any category. In terms of design, the project will consist of both 3D and 2D design techniques. I plan on creating the final product as unique as possible.

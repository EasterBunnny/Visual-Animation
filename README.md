What you see in front of you is a basic rundown of a new project that I'm starting on. This project will be done solo therefore I may not be able to give you daily updates.

This will be made in several different software engines. The primary one being Unity.

This project is primarily based on User Interface, however, that may vary at times. It doesn't fall into any specific category, due to it simply being experimental! For now, the project will consist of 2 different styles. 1 of them being 3D and the other 2D. Not to fear, they will differ from each other, yet be able to simultaneously maintain some similarities.
